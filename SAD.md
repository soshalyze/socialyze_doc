using a number of different architectural views to depict different aspects of the system. 
It is intended to capture and convey the significant architectural decisions which have been made on the system.

### 1.2 Scope
The scope of this SAD is to show the architecture of the Socialyze project. Affected are the class structure, the use cases and the data representation.

## 2. Architectural Representation
Socialyze uses the MVD Pattern from Django for its architecture design.

## 3.Architectural Goals and Constraints 
We decided to use praw for the back-end as a connection to reddit and Plotty for the front-end for the visualization of the dataset.
Both components are coupled by the Rest-API.
