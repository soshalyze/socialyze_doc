## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) was created to collect and 
organize the requirements for the Socialyze website. 
The SRS describes all specifications for the application "Socialyze". 
It includes an overview about this project and its vision, detailed information about the planned features and boundary conditions of the development process. Also it describes the behavior and use cases of our software artifact.


### 1.2 Scope

This application will be an information visualization web application where users can create custom 
visualizations of social network trends, user networks, and other public information. 
Users will be able to choose from a selection of websites and datasets to create visualizations in order to better study or portray social media trends and topics. The site will offer an interactive graphical interface over which the users can select datasets and types of visualizations (bar graphs, diagrams, network graphs). Modifications to the visualization's settings will be immediately visible to the user. If possible (and relevant), the visualized datasets will show live updates.
The exact details will be worked out in future.

### 1.5 Overview

The following chapter provides an overview of this project with vision, the functionality of the result and an Overall Use Case Diagram. 
The third chapter (Requirements Specification) delivers more details about the specific requirements in terms of functionality, usability and design parameters. 
In order to achieve a high level of specification in defining the requirements, all functions presented in the diagram are separated into subsections of section "3.1 Functionality". 
And last there is chapter four with supporting information.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Vision

Socialyze will offer its users an online interface that allows them to extract data from their social media profiles by entering their user data or connecting the app to their social media accounts.
Users can then create visualizations from these datasets that allow them to gain insights into their social media activities.
For example, a Reddit user will be able to create a ranking of their most posted to or commented on subreddits, a word cloud of their comments,
or correlate the number of upvotes on a post or comment with the subreddit the content was posted on.

The app will consist of a web presence created in Python's *Django* framework.
The site will allow users to save their social media datasets to a server-side database.
From there, the data can be reused on subsequent visits.
Users will be able to choose one or more datasets and a compatible visualization, which the app will then create and display.
From there, a user will have the option to export the visualization and save a local copy.

## 2.2 Product Perspective

Socialyze is a webapp, i.e. an online presence accessed by users via a web browser.
It will include the following features:

* **User accounts** - Users will be able to create an account on the site.
  Users may then add various social media identities (providers tbd) to their account.
  Depending on the accounts added, users will then have access to various datasets mined from their social media presence.
* **Visualization toolbox** - A user will be able to select datasets from his social media presence and visualization types
  (e.g. bar graphs, time-series graphs, pie charts).
  The app will then create a visualization conforming to the user's specifications.
* **Database** - User datasets scraped or collected from the social network API will be stored in the app's database,
  where users will be able to access them on subsequent logins.
* **Export** - Users will be able to export and save the visualizations they create in common file formats (PNG, PDF).
* **Data filtering** - Users will be able to filter datasets by certain criteria, such as their age or content.

### 2.3 User Characteristics

The user needs a modern graphical web browser and access to the internet in order to use Socialyze.
While a fundamental understanding of information visualization is certainly useful,
the goal of the app is to provide an interface that enables lay users to create interesting visualizations.
Additionally, the user will need to supply one or more social media identities.
Therefore, in order to meaningfully use the application, a user must have at least one account on a social media site supported by Socialyze.

### 2.4 Dependencies

Socialyze is heavily dependent on the social media sites it draws its datasets from.
In particular, this means that the app is very dependent on the APIs it uses to query data from social media sites.
If a site does not supply a certain data point (e.g. a channel's exact subscriber count on YouTube, as of September 2019),
then the data point cannot be made available to users.
Since a certain amount of data will almost surely be obtained through webscraping,
the app's functionality will also be impacted by possible overhauls or redesign efforts on part of its data source pages.

On the user side, the app is dependent on the type of web browser used.
A browser that does not support HTML5 will struggle to correctly display the content of Socialyze.
Socialyze is, for obvious reasons, incompatible with a text-based webbrowser.
For development purposes, the team will limit itself to developing the app for use with the current versions of three widely used webbrowsers:
Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, and Microsoft Edge (as of 18/10/2020).

## 3. Specific Requirements

### 3.1 Functionality ï¿½ Data Backend

#### 3.1.1 Data Acquisition Module

* **Retrieve data from Social Media** - 
For Data visualization we need lots of data, which is needed to question from social media platforms.
Therefore, we have two options: 

  * **Getting data Via API** - 
If we get the data via the API of a social-media network we have the borders of a maximum of API calls.
If a user wants small datasets visualized this is an easy possibility to get this data.

  * **Getting data Via scraping** -
If we question this Data via scraping, we do simulate normal access to the social media network and read the data directly from the website. For this we want to use Python, but we need to check if therefore the Django or the Selenium framework works better. 

* **Write to DB** -
After getting the data from social Media weâre going to write the scraped data to our Database, that we can visualize this data later.

### 3.1.2 Data Visualization Module

To receive all the information from the database there is an additional module required.
With this module the specific datasets from the database are moved to visualization interface.

* **Fetch data from database** - 
A very important point is to read only the necessary information from the database.
To reduce workload from fetch data it is required to develop corresponding methods.

* **Transform data to user specification** - 
It is necessary that the visualization Interface understand the transferred data from the visualization module.
On this case something like a protocol is required.

### 3.2 Functionality ï¿½ User Interface

#### 3.2.1 Account Management

* **User creation** - 
The User Creation works over a registration page. Therefore, we need to send the data to the database. Additionally, it will send a verification Mail to activate the account. If the activation-key at this mail is valid, the account is activated.
* **User login** - 
The User Login should login the user. Therefore, we compare the typed in login data with the data from the database. Furthermore a remember me functionality should be available. There will also be a function which redirects the User to the Login Page if he isnât logged in.
* **User update** - 
The user update page gives the user the possibility to change his data and to add additional data like a profile image. 
* **Password reset** - 
To reset the password a mail with an activation key will be sent to the user (like the user activation mail in user creation) than the user gets access to the reset password page, where he is able to reset the password.

#### 3.2.2 User Visualization Interface

It is an interface necessary which provide different visualization methods for the user.
With the interface the user can request different datasets from the database.

* **Select different datasets from database** - 
Through the fact that the user can filter information.
The interface needs the possibility to get specific datasets from the database.
For this the component must provide different methods for every kind of dataset which is requested.

Mockup:

* **Selection of different views** - 
One more requirement are the different views for the visualization.
The user can use different options to see and filter the datasets.
